## 🎤 Interview Talking Points

### Project Overview (30 seconds)
"I built an e-commerce analytics dashboard that helps businesses understand their sales performance and customer behavior. I analyzed over 500,000 transactions from a UK retailer, implemented customer segmentation using RFM analysis, and created interactive visualizations for stakeholders to explore the data. The dashboard is deployed online and accessible via a shareable link."

### Technical Deep-Dive (if asked)
1. **Data Processing**: "I cleaned the data by removing null values and invalid transactions, then engineered features like time components and calculated metrics."

2. **Customer Segmentation**: "I implemented RFM analysis, which scores customers based on recency of purchase, frequency of orders, and monetary value. This creates 7 segments like Champions, At Risk, and Lost Customers."

3. **Visualization**: "I chose specific chart types based on the data story - line charts for trends, bar charts for comparisons, and an interactive map for geographic distribution."

4. **Deployment**: "I used Streamlit for rapid development and deployed on Streamlit Cloud, which provides free hosting and automatic SSL."

### Key Insights (always have 2-3 ready)
- "The top 10% of customers generate approximately X% of total revenue"
- "Sales peak between 10 AM and 3 PM, indicating ideal times for promotions"
- "The UK represents over 80% of revenue, suggesting opportunities for international expansion"
